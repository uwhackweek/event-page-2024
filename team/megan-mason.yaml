  bio: >
    I've been involved with SnowEx Field Campaigns and past Hackweeks since 2018. 
    I work closely with the ground-based observations and manage much of the SnowEx data to get it publish and archived at NSIDC. 
    I host monthly SnowEx Community Calls to keep the snow community informed of recent data releases and other relevent updates.
    I love being in the field taking snow measurements. 
  expertise:
    - SnowEx data products
    - Ground sampling design
    - Data QA/QC
