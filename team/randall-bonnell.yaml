  bio: >
    I'm a recent PhD graduate out of Colorado State University. I'm a snow hydrologist/geophysicist and I study snow with radar. 
    I have evaluated InSAR retrevials of snow water equivalent with ground-based radar and I've helped develop a technique for
    combining ground-based radar with lidar to derive snow density.
  expertise:
    - Ground-penetrating radar
